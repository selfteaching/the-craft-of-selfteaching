           **The Legal Small Print**
        
           (Three Pages)
        
           ***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
        
           Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
           They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
           your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
           someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
           fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
           disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
           you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
        
           *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
        
           By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
           etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
           this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
           a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
           sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
           you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
           medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
        
           ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
        
           This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
           etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael
           S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
        
           Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States
           copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy
           and distribute it in the United States without permission and
           without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth below,
           apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the
           Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
        
           To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
           efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
           works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
           medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
           things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
           corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
           intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
           disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
           codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
        
           LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
        
           But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
           [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
           etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
           liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
           legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
           UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
           INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
           OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
           POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
           If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
           receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
           you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
           time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
           on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
           such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
           copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
           choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
           receive it electronically.
        
           THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
           WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
           TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
           LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        
           Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
           the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
           above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
           may have other legal rights.
        
           INDEMNITY
        
           You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
           officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
           and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
           indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
           [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
           or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.
        
           DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
        
           You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
           disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
           "Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
           or:
        
           1. Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this requires
              that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or this "small
              print!" statement.  You may however, if you wish, distribute this
              etext in machine readable binary, compressed, mark-up, or
              proprietary form, including any form resulting from conversion by
              word pro- cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
              *EITHER*:
        
              * The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and does *not*
              contain characters other than those intended by the author of the
              work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_)
              characters may be used to convey punctuation intended by the
              author, and additional characters may be used to indicate
              hypertext links; OR
        
              * The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no expense
              into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the program that
              displays the etext (as is the case, for instance, with most word
              processors); OR
        
              * You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no
              additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in its
              original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or other equivalent
              proprietary form).
        
           2. Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this "Small
              Print!" statement.
        
           3. Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the gross
              profits you derive calculated using the method you already use to
              calculate your applicable taxes.  If you don't derive profits, no
              royalty is due.  Royalties are payable to "Project Gutenberg
              Literary Archive Foundation" the 60 days following each date you
              prepare (or were legally required to prepare) your annual (or
              equivalent periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
              let us know your plans and to work out the details.
        
           WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?  The
           Project gratefully accepts contributions of money, time, public
           domain etexts, and royalty free copyright licenses.  If you are
           interested in contributing scanning equipment or software or other
           items, please contact Michael Hart at: hart@pobox.com

           ******This file should be named mthes10.zip******
        
           Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, mthes11.zip
           VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, mthes10a.zip
        
           This etext was prepared by Mike Pullen, 
           globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com.
        
           Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
           all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
           copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
           of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
        
           We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
           of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
           Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
           the official publication date.
        
           Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
           midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
           The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
           Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
           preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
           and editing by those who wish to do so.

           Those of you who want to download our Etexts before announcment
           can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
           also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
           indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
           announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

           as it appears in our Newsletters.
        
           Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
        
           We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
           time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
           to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
           searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
           projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
           per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
           million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
           files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
           If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
           should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
        
           The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
           Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
           This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
           which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
        
           At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
           of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
           manage to get some real funding.
        
           Something is needed to create a future for Project Gutenberg for
           the next 100 years.

           your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
           someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
           fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
           disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
           you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
        
           *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
        
           By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
           etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
           this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
           a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
           sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
           you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
           medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
        
           ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
        
           This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
           etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael
           S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
        
           Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States
           copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy
           and distribute it in the United States without permission and
           without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth below,
           apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the
           Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
        
           To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
           efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
           works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
           medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
           things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
           corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
           intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
           disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
           codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
        
           LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
        
           But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
           [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
           etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
           liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
           legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
           UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
           INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
           OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
           POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        
           If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
           receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
           you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
           time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
           on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
           such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
           copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
           choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
           receive it electronically.
        
           THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
           WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
           TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
           LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        
           Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
           the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
           above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
           may have other legal rights.
        
           INDEMNITY
        
           You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
           officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
           and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
           indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
           [1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
           or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.
        
           DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
        
           You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
           disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
           "Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
           or:
        
           1. Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this requires
              that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or this "small
              print!" statement.  You may however, if you wish, distribute this
              etext in machine readable binary, compressed, mark-up, or
              proprietary form, including any form resulting from conversion by
              word pro- cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
              *EITHER*:
        
              * The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and does *not*
              contain characters other than those intended by the author of the
              work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_)
              characters may be used to convey punctuation intended by the
              author, and additional characters may be used to indicate
              hypertext links; OR
        
              * The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no expense
              into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the program that
              displays the etext (as is the case, for instance, with most word
              processors); OR
        
              * You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no
              additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in its
              original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or other equivalent
              proprietary form).
        
           2. Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this "Small
              Print!" statement.
        
           3. Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the gross
              profits you derive calculated using the method you already use to
              calculate your applicable taxes.  If you don't derive profits, no
              royalty is due.  Royalties are payable to "Project Gutenberg
              Literary Archive Foundation" the 60 days following each date you
              prepare (or were legally required to prepare) your annual (or
              equivalent periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
              let us know your plans and to work out the details.
        
           WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
           The Project gratefully accepts contributions of money, time,
           public domain etexts, and royalty free copyright licenses.

           Moby (tm) Thesaurus II Documentation Notes
        
           This documentation, the software and/or database are:
        
           Public Domain material by grant from the author, January, 2001.
        
        
           Moby (tm) Thesaurus for the MSDOS operating system is compressed and
           distributed as a single zip file.  After extraction, the vocabulary
           files included with this product are in ordinary ASCII format with
           CRLF (ASCII 13/10) delimiters.

           NOTE: Accents have been stripped from words, e.g., 'etude' does not
           mark the accent on the initial 'e'.
        
           Moby Thesaurus is the largest and most comprehensive thesaurus data
           source in English available for commercial use.  This second edition
           has been thoroughly revised adding more than 5,000 root words (to
           total more than 30,000) with an additional _million_ synonyms and
           related terms (to total more than 2.5 _million_ synonyms and related
           terms).  Although this thesaurus is provided in a very simple ASCII
           format suitable to viewing, editing, and automatic parsing, most
           users will consider reformatting schemes to represent the data in a
           more economical form, such as table of related terms whose index can
           be shared by many roots.  This is roughly the technique used by the
           thesaurus in print form that has the large index coupled with the
           synonyms under abstract (and arbitrary) headings in the front matter.
           Tables of related terms can be stored in, for example, LZ compressed
           form until actually required by the application.  Combining such
           schemes could easily reduce the storage requirement of this data by
           an order of magnitude or more.  The supplementary file, roget13a.txt,
           provides a small thesaurus already organized in this form that you
           may wish to use as a guide when developing your own categories of
           synonyms.  Also, of course, uncommon words can be stripped out
           according to the developer's criterion, keeping only the core and
           most oftenly used information.  Once unarchived, the database format
           is flat-file ASCII: each record (delimited from other records with a
           terminal carriage return/linefeed [ASCII 13/10] character) is of the
           form:
        
           (In this example, the root word is 'frill', which is always the first
           word of the list.  The synonyms and related words are listed in ASCII
           alphabetical order after the root.  Each entry, including the root,
           is followed by a comma.  The last entry in a record is followed by a
           carriage return/linefeed [ASCII 13/10].)

           Part-of-Speech information is not stored with this thesaurus.  A
           separate file (mposp10.zip) available from Project Gutenberg by the
           same author supplies a separate lexical database providing the
           part(s)-of-speech for a large collection (>200,000) of English words
           and phrases that can be used in conjunction with this list to supply
           POS information if needed by the particular application.
        
        
           Quick Start
        
           1. Insure you have at least 26Mb of free disk space to hold the contents
              of this zip file.
           2. Create a directory to hold these files listed above.
           3. Extract the contents of this zip file into the destination directory
              using any compatible zip file extraction utility.
           4. Delete the original zip file from your disk to save space.  (optional)
